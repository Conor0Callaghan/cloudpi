# cloudpi

The code in this repo integrates with the code in my pidashboard repo. This is the cloud component described in the [opensource.com article](https://opensource.com/article/17/3/pi-display-dashboard)

**NOTICE** This code was written several years ago and probably doesn't work in the current openshift.com setup.
